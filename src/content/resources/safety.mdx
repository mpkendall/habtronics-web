## FCC Transmitting Requirements
- To transmit on the ham radio bands, you need an FCC issued callsign.
- This callsign is issued when you pass the amateur radio Technician exam.
- The Technician level is the lowest level and easiest to get of three FCC amateur radio license levels, and it is all you need to transmit on the 70cm band that Tiny4FSK uses.
Studying for and getting this license can easily be done in a week, and you can click here for some step by step instructions.
- Once you have your callsign, it just needs to be transmitted at least once every 10 minutes when doing continuous transmission.  This is the default setting for Tiny4FSK, but this interval can be adjusted in the config file.
- Lastly, please try to respect and work with other operators you find to be transmitting on your frequency, either by changing frequencies (“channels”) or coordinating with the other operator.

## FAA Airspace Regulations for Unmanned Free Balloons
- Part 101 explains all the regulations that govern high altitude balloon launched in the US.  The FAA refers to these as “Unmanned Free Balloons.”
- Subpart A is the part you will need to know most, as this describes the conditions that, if met, require you to do many other things. 
- Here's a short summary:
    - Most lightweight HAB launches are not regulated.  If you follow these guidelines, you fall below the threshold to qualify as an Unmanned Free Balloon, and are not legally required to take any special steps for FAA compliance:
        - Do not carry a payload package that weighs more than four pounds and has a weight/size ratio of more than three ounces per square inch on any surface of the package, determined by dividing the total weight in ounces of the payload package by the area in square inches of its smallest surface;
        - Do not carry a payload package that weighs more than six pounds;
        - Do not carry a payload, of two or more packages, that weighs more than 12 pounds (this is total flight train weight)
        - Do not use a rope or other device for suspension of the payload that requires an impact force of more than 50 pounds to separate the suspended payload from the balloon
        - You can search for 50 lb kite string on Amazon to find compliant payload lines, such as Braided Dacron line.
- There are a couple other clauses that legally apply as well:
    - No person may operate any moored balloon, kite, amateur rocket, or unmanned free balloon in a manner that creates a hazard to other persons, or their property.
    - No person operating any moored balloon, kite, amateur rocket, or unmanned free balloon may allow an object to be dropped therefrom, if such action creates a hazard to other persons or their property.
- How to be RESPONSIBLE:
    - Just because you are not legally required to take these steps, doesn’t mean you shouldn’t.  Even with lightweight payloads, we strongly recommend doing these simple steps to help keep other aircraft safe.
    - Notify the FAA and other airmen of your flight plan. This can be done using these two steps:
        - Complete a HIBAL Worksheet
            - Lately, this has been the method preferred by FAA representatives we have talked to.
            - Email 9-ATO-ESA-OSG-AirspaceWaiver@faa.gov and request a HIBAL Worksheet for an upcoming balloon flight. 
            - Fill out the worksheet to the best of your ability and email it back.  This will allow you to also apply for regulatory exemptions if needed.
            - Send an update 24 hours before your flight if your flight plan changes. They will often give you direct phone numbers for local Air Traffic Control to call if your flight plan needs to change again within the final 24 hours.
        - File a NOTAM (notice to airmen)
            - This can be done by simply calling the national NOTAM hotline. Try to do this 48 hours before your launch, then call again to make any changes to your flight plan: 1-877-487-6867
            - Information to have ready:
                - Launch time, launch coordinates (lat, long).
                - Rough compass direction of flight path.
                - Estimated length of flight (give an extra hour for buffer).
                - Predicted landing coordinates (lat, long) and radius of uncertainty. If you are using prediction software and filling your balloon accurately, you can estimate 5-10 km.
                - Max altitude.
                - Nearest airport and distance in nautical miles. They will generally look this up for you.
    - Fly a lightweight radar reflector on your flight train.

    - ALWAYS use a parachute on your flight train!  This is especially important to prevent injury or damage on the ground when payloads land. You can find parachutes for high altitude balloons at places like:
        - [Rocketman Parachutes](https://www.the-rocketman.com/products/high-altitude-balloon-parachutes)
        - When picking a size and looking at their descent rate estimates:
            - Aim for 15 ft/sec
            - Include the entire weight of your balloon
            - Add an extra foot to parachute diameter
            - We have found their descent rate estimates to be overly optimistic
    - Avoid launching or landing within restricted Class B, C, D, or E airspace.
        - These are airspaces around airports that are coordinated by ATC (air traffic control).
        - You can see these airspaces using “Sectional Charts,” from sites such as [SkyVector](https://skyvector.com/).
        - To understand how these airspaces and charts work, please visit [Pilot Institute's airspace guide](https://pilotinstitute.com/airspace-explained/).
        - Class B airspace is the busiest airspace for other aircraft, so make sure to avoid it. Operations in any other controlled airspace (such as Class C, D, and E) require appropriate ATC clearance; the 9-ATO-ESA-OSG-AirspaceWaiver@faa.gov address is for advance coordination and waiver requests, not real-time entry into controlled airspace.
